# Code_Complexity_Checker_Tool_Research_Project
The research project focuses on a code complexity checker tool that compares cyclomatic complexity, weighted composite complexity, and a newly developed metric. It evaluates code complexity using these methods to provide deeper insights into software efficiency, maintainability, and performance.
